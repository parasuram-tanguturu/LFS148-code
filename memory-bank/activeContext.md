# Active Context: Current Work and Focus

## Current Focus

**Primary Objective**: Establishing comprehensive memory bank documentation for the LFS148 OpenTelemetry exercise repository.

**Current Activity**: Creating memory bank structure and documenting repository patterns, architecture, and technical context.

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation (Current Session)

- Created `memory-bank/` directory structure
- Created core documentation files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Repository foundation and learning objectives
  - `productContext.md`: Educational purpose and user experience
  - `techContext.md`: Technology stack and dependencies
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns
  - `activeContext.md`: Current work focus (this file)
  - `progress.md`: Status and next steps

## Active Decisions

### Documentation Approach

- **Decision**: Create comprehensive memory bank following the standard structure
- **Rationale**: Enables effective context recovery after memory resets
- **Status**: In progress

### Exercise Documentation

- **Decision**: Document exercise structure and patterns at high level
- **Rationale**: Memory bank focuses on overall patterns, not individual exercise details
- **Status**: Documented in `systemPatterns.md`

### Technology Documentation

- **Decision**: Document all technologies and versions used
- **Rationale**: Critical for understanding dependencies and compatibility
- **Status**: Documented in `techContext.md`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete memory bank file creation
2. ✅ Document all core patterns and context
3. ⏭️ Review memory bank completeness
4. ⏭️ Verify documentation accuracy

### Future Considerations

#### Potential Enhancements

- **Exercise-Specific Documentation**: Consider adding detailed documentation for each exercise category if needed
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions for students
- **Learning Path Documentation**: Recommended order for completing exercises
- **Integration Testing**: Verify all exercises work with current tool versions

#### Maintenance Tasks

- **Version Updates**: Track OpenTelemetry SDK version updates
- **Docker Image Updates**: Monitor for new collector and backend versions
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep memory bank current as repository evolves

## Active Questions

### Resolved

- ✅ What is the repository structure? → Documented in `projectbrief.md`
- ✅ What technologies are used? → Documented in `techContext.md`
- ✅ What are the architectural patterns? → Documented in `systemPatterns.md`

### Open Questions

- Are there specific exercises that need additional documentation?
- Should we document common student issues or troubleshooting steps?
- Is there a preferred learning path through the exercises?

## Current State Summary

### Repository Status

- **Structure**: Well-organized with clear exercise categories
- **Code**: Complete initial and solution implementations
- **Documentation**: Basic README files present, memory bank being created
- **Docker Setup**: Complete Docker Compose configurations

### Memory Bank Status

- **Foundation**: Complete
- **Context**: Comprehensive documentation created
- **Patterns**: Architecture and design patterns documented
- **Progress**: Current state and next steps documented

## Work Context

### Session Goals

- Establish memory bank for future context recovery
- Document repository structure and patterns
- Capture technical context and dependencies
- Record current state and next steps

### Success Criteria

- ✅ All core memory bank files created
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation of repository
- ✅ Clear understanding of architecture and patterns
- ✅ Documented current state and future considerations

## Notes

- Repository appears to be a learning resource, not an active development project
- Exercises are self-contained and can be worked independently
- Docker-based setup makes exercises easy to run and test
- Solution directories provide reference implementations for learning
